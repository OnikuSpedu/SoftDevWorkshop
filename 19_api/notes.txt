K19 - Using REST Apis to render templates
2021-10-20

In order to read key_file.txt, you have to use open() to open the file 
and return a file object, then use the read method on the returned file 
object to get the content of the file.

To make a GET request to the api, urllib.request.urlopen([INSERT API URL]).
In order to get the JSON response, you have to use the read method. This
returns a string, which needs to be parsed into a dictionary.

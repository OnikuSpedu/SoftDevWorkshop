DISCO
Using class style utilities is so much easier and quicker than
adding custom CSS. The development experience is much better.
I feel like I can do most things with Bootstrap. Bootstrap feels
more fleshed out than foundation.

QCC
Why is style outside of head?
Is that SASS/SCSS inside of the style tag? Doesn't SASS need to be compiled?

Q0
Yes, the group only provided the starting template with the CDN.

Q1
I prefer bootstrap because it provides more utilities by default.
It provides padding utilities, margin, background, font, etc.
The documentation is clearer and there is a more active
community.

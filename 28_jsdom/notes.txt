K28 - Getting more comfortable with the dev console and the DOM
2022-02-08t

I'm already proficient at JavaScript and TypeScript because of working at Provecho.bio.
Nothing too interesting to note. The DOM is essentially a tree, so maybe it would be
fun to invert it. Manually creating elements is a pain, and I now have a deeper appreciation
for Svelte and React.
